# Project Proposal

## Collaboration

### Project title
RemRx

### What and why?
This is an application that helps users keep track of the medications that they need to take. The user will be able to enter their medications and the time of day when they need to take them and the dosage or the specific instruction for taking that medication. 

People have trouble remembering when and what prescribed medication they need to take. This obsviously has adverse and deleterious consequences on their health. Given that now most people have a smart phone, this application will help them to make sure that they properly take the right medication in prescribed dosages and stay on track to live a healthy life. 


### For whom?
This application will be for anybody who takes medications and often finds themselves forgeting to either take it because they forget or because they have to take several medications. So, this application is for people of old age and for even young kids for whom their parents can use this application to remind themselves to give their children the medication.  

Given that the application will be used by different age groups, we need to develop it so its very easy to use. 

### How?
A user will first needs to create an account by entering all of their relevant information. Next, they will be presented with a dashboard which will keep track of each of their medications. Here, they can either create a new entry for a medication or edit/modify existing entries of medications. So, they will be able to create a new entry by entering the medications name, the time of day or day of week when they need to take it, the dosage, the intake medications instructions, and whether to send a notifications as a reminder. After they have created an entry, then it will be presented on the dashboard. There they can click on the entry again to modify/edit it and save it. 

### Scope
This application is modest in terms of ambition for a group to undertake in one semester. 
The biggest challenge will be building the interface that is easy to use. The front-end, the interface and the dashboard, will be mostly develop using React.js, CSS. The back-end, we will need to set up a database to keep track of user information. 

In addition, there are several extra features that we can build on top for example having the ability to track health metrics that are impacted by their medication intake. An example of this would be a user who takes a blood pressure medication and they will be able to record their blood pressure before and after taking the medication to see whether its helping them on the long run.
